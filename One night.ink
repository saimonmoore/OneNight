It was almost a sensation that pure evil had come to visit you at two thirty in the morning. # colour it blue

=== going_to_bed === 
As you lowered your tired body onto your bed, a haunting sensation swept over you that left you with a sense of uneasiness. You closed your eyes, feeling that they wouldn't be closed very long and wouldn't get many chances to stay closed tonight. # CLASS: danger

 * [They didn't, in fact, stay closed for very long.]

 * Surprising yourself proudly, you resisted the temptation of late-night browsing

About 20 seconds later, your eyelids flipped open and your right arm was already reaching for your fruity smart phone.

Heavily asleep as you were, at around 02:30 hours, you were suddenly jolted out of your sleep! The lovely, peaceful, trance involving your upcoming trip to see Yoann Bourgeois Company in Portes-LÃ¨s-Valence, writing a letter to your girlfriend on old parchment with a feather and ink and the occasional erotic interlude, swiftly blurred our of your mind, replaced with a feeling on anxiety and drainage.

You looked up and saw a tall dark figure followed by a strange sensation on your exposed toes. Apparently this thing, was tapping your toes!
